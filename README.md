# Queue Manager

This is a simple solution to the problem proposed by my **High Performance Code** teacher.

The problem resumes in using the queue data structure to build an application to manage a bank queue. There\`re two types of queues: **Priority Queue** and a **Non-Priority Queue** and we must use the queue structure to handle the order that the customers are attended.

## Installation

Use npm install or yarn install to get all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar



foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
